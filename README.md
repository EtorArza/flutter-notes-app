# Frek - Memorize with cards and spaced repetitions

A Flutter app to memorize with spaced repetitions.

## Features
1. *Review with spaced repetitions*: Periodically revisit learned concepts with the spaced learning technique [1] to maximize recall while minimizing time studied. Cards that are due are signaled with a blue circle. Once a card is recalled, the next review date needs to be chosen. Cards can be marked as learned, when we consider that we have permanently commited them to memory.

2. *Organize cards in collections*: Organize cards by subject, and get statistics of the number of cards learned so far.

5. *Formatting text*: Change the color and style of the text to highlight words or letters. For example, I use red blue and green to highlight the gender of German nouns.
