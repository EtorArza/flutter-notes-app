# Memorize with cards and spaced repetitions

A Flutter app to memorize with spaced repetitions.

## Features
1. *Review with spaced repetitions*: Periodically revisit learned concepts with the spaced learning technique [1] to maximize recall while minimizing time studied.
2. *Backup*: Backup all your cards to keep them safe and restore them later.
3. *Sharing*: Share one or more cards with family and friends.
4: *Formatting text*: Change the color and style of the text to highlight words or letters. For example, I use red blue and green to highlight the gender of German nouns.
